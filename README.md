# Interactive 3D Scene - Graphics Processing Course Project

## Project Overview
This project, developed as part of the **Graphics Processing Course**, showcases the application of advanced **OpenGL** techniques through the creation of an interactive 3D scene. The scene, inspired by a modern and futuristic broadcast studio from the game *Honkai Star Rail*, combines dynamic elements and real-time rendering to provide a visually captivating and technically robust experience.
