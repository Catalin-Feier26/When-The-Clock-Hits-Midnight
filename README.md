# Interactive 3D Scene - Graphics Processing Course Project

## Project Overview
This project, developed as part of the **Graphics Processing Course**, showcases the application of advanced **OpenGL** techniques through the creation of an interactive 3D scene. The scene, inspired by a modern and futuristic broadcast studio from the game *Honkai Star Rail*, combines dynamic elements and real-time rendering to provide a visually captivating and technically robust experience.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ® **Interactive 3D Scene**
- **Immersive Studio Environment:** A detailed and engaging setting designed to captivate users.
- **Dynamic Elements:** Includes fireworks, music notes, and gold rain, bringing life and motion to the scene.

### ðŸ’¡ **Core OpenGL Functionalities**
- **Lighting Effects:** Realistic directional and point lighting, with dynamic toggling and shadow mapping for enhanced depth and realism.
- **Camera Navigation:** Smooth and responsive freeform movement, supported by BÃ©zier curve interpolation for fluid transitions during guided tours.
- **Environmental Effects:** Interactive features like fog, dynamic skybox rendering, and shader-based visual effects such as sepia and black-and-white filters.
- **Real-Time Animations:** Particle systems power dynamic animations like fireworks and gold rain, adding interactivity and excitement.

### ðŸš€ **Advanced Techniques**
- **Shadow Mapping:** Creates realistic and dynamic shadows.
- **Particle Systems:** Enables visually engaging animations.
- **Skybox Rendering:** Provides a detailed and expansive environment.
- **Custom Shaders:** Implements post-processing visual effects and filters.
